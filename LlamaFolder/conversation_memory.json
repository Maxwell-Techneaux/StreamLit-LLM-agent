    "response": "Hi there! I'm happy to help you understand how CygNet supports alarm management. \n\nAccording to the Common Alarm Service (CAS) documentation, CygNet provides centralized alarm processing for current value services (CVSs). When a CVS receives a value for a point that meets or exceeds an alarm setpoint, the CVS reports the alarm to the CAS. This means that CygNet allows you to configure alarm setpoints and alarm reporting on a per-point basis in the point configuration record.\n\nYou can use CygNet Explorer, CygNet Studio, or CygNet Vision to view alarms. Additionally, the ELSALM stores alarm history for future reference.\n\nFor more information on how to work with alarms in CygNet, I recommend checking out the Alarms topic page [1]. This will give you a comprehensive overview of alarm management within the platform.\n\nIn summary, Cygnet supports alarm management by providing centralized processing and reporting, as well as tools for viewing and storing alarms. If you have any specific questions or concerns about alarm management in CygNet, feel free to ask!\n\n[1] https://softwaredocs.weatherford.com/cygnet/94/Content/Topics/Alarms/Alarms.htm",
